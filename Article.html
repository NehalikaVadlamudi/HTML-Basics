        <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>An introductory paragraph is critical to your blog post because it sets the tone for what you are going to talk about. It is important that you write an engaging intro so that people will want to keep reading and learn more from your article. In this article, we will talk about how to write a blog post intro that engages readers and leads them further into the article.</p>
        <h2 id="Content">Content</h2>
        <p>First of all, a good paragraph intro should start with a “hook” sentence. A hook sentence is meant to catch your reader’s attention, which would make them want to read more about what you’re writing about. The first sentence of an article is often the most important. It should capture the reader’s attention, give them a glimpse into what the rest of the article will talk about, and it should be clear and concise. A poorly written first sentence can result in losing potential readers because they too will move on to another article that better captures their attention.</p>

            <h2><mark>Importance of opening statement</mark></h2>
            <p>One way to explain the importance of an opening statement is to think about how one would summarize someone else’s article. A good opening paragraph will tell the reader right away what the author wants them to know, without giving too much detail or including the irrelevant background information.</p>
